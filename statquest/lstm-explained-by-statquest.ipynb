    "The video explains Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network that avoids the exploding/vanishing gradient problem by using separate paths for long-term and short-term memories. It breaks down how LSTM units work using sigmoid and tan-h activation functions to process input data and make predictions.\n",
