    "The video explains Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in a clear and understandable manner, using stock market data as an example. It highlights the importance of RNNs in handling sequential data and discusses the challenges like the Vanishing/Exploding Gradient Problem. The video concludes by mentioning Long Short-Term Memory Networks as a solution to these issues.\n",
